## Project Description

A cookie distributor called Flea Cookies has hired us - Team Pink - to predict their customers' perceived quality of the products in its portfolio. <br> Flea Cookies is suffering from financial problems as a result of failures in predicting their sales - they have overstocked some categories by 40% and understocked others by 25%. They have purchased a cookie dataset and asked the team to develop a Machine Learning model to predict the cookies' perceived quality. They have provided us with a training dataset and the predictor variables for a testing dataset. Nevertheless, they have concealed the predictor variables for the testing dataset from us, as they will use it to judge the root mean square error of our model. 

## Dataset

We were given a 16 column dataset with cookies characteristics and around 5000 observations. The target variable was the Quality of the cookies.

## Workflow
- Understanding Dataset
- Wrangling Data
- Design Data Pre-Processing Pipelines
- Assemble and Optimize ML Models
- Pitch our Model to a Jury


## Organization

-In order to develop our model, we worked as a team to plan our workflow. We then divided activities and collaborated with our code through GitHub, meeting regularly to take decisions on key elements of the pipeline.
Once the pre-processing pipeline was ready, the remaining tasks and model training were divided into each component of the group.

## Repository

Folders structure:
- Presentation: A ppt to pitch our model to the client. 
- Machine Learning Pipeline: The team's complete analysis, pre-processing, and modeling of the data.
- Other Model Results: Results from models that were tested but discarded.
- Data: Contains a complete training dataset and the predictor variables for a testing dataset.
